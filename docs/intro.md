# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Knowledge Space

This site is a living archive of my thoughts, projects, and technical learnings.  
As a graduate student and developer, I document what I learn so I can build better, think deeper, and share freely.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here

- **About Me**: Personal background and journey  
- **Projects**: My key works and experiments  
- **Mindfulness Blog**: Notes on anxiety, awareness, and self-growth  
- **Technical Notes**: Concepts in AI, web development, and infrastructure

## âœ¨ Why This Site?

I believe writing is a form of thinking.  
This site is not just a portfolioâ€”it's a learning companion, a memory bank, and sometimes a mirror.

Thanks for visiting!
